# Become a nutrix sponsor
Nutrix is a GPL-2.0 licensed open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and develop new features for the project is made sustainable by the help of generous financial backing of our sponsors.

## How to sponsor
Sponsorships can be done via [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/elmawardy). Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted.
