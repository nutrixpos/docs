# About NutrixPOS

NutrixPOS is a free and open source Point of Sale system founded by Amr Elmawardy in Giza, Egypt. Our mission is to provide restaurant owners with a powerful, reliable, and completely free alternative to expensive proprietary software.

## The Story Behind the Code

The project is the direct result of our founder's own journey. In 2024 Amr Elmawardy opened his own restaurant, he faced the same operational challenges and software frustrations that many business owners do. Instead of accepting the status quo, he leveraged his 12-year background as a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer to build a better solution.

NutrixPOS was born from this unique combination of hands-on business experience and deep technical expertise. We believe in the power of open source to foster innovation and accessibility for everyone, everywhere.
